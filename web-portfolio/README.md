Reflection:

I created my web portfolio mainly using Bootstrap. This is the first time I have created a site using both bootstrap and CSS. I faced a few challenges because it was hard to decide which method would be the best when customizing a section. I had to decide of it would look better using Bootstrap or CSS. I learned that to make a website quick, the fastest way would be to use Bootstrap first and make all the small adjustments with CSS. 

The assets I used on this site was Bootsrap. I used Source Sans Pro, Noto Sans, and Roboto from google fonts.

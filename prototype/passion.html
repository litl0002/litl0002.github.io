              <h3>Working Out</h3>
              <p>
                  I first started working out in my grade 11 year of highschool in cross fit. After the semester ended I got a gym membership but I would only go every few weeks. In the past 4 months I have been going to the gym 6 days of the week. The gym has become a place I feel safe in and it encourages me to do better everyday.

              <h3>Sports/ Curling</h3>
              <p>
                  I have been curling for as long as I can remember. I've been told that I started at the age of 4 and have curling ever since. In my final year of highschool my team and I made it to provincials were we placed second overall. I hope I can continue to play well passed retirement!

                <p>
                    I am currently attending Algonquin College taking the Interactive Media Design program. I aspire to be a videographer after graduation. In highschool I graduated on the honor role, I participated in many clubs, and was a part of many sports teams.

                <h3>My Hometown</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born just north of Carleton Place, however I have lived in Carleton Place my entire life. It is a small town west of Ottawa with a population of over 11 thousand people. It has a very fast growing population due to its proximity to Ottawa. The town runs along the Mississippi River and has the oldest Canoe Club in Canada.

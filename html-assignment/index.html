        <p>All throughout my life I have enjoyed taking photos, which has lead me to <em>Algonquin College</em> in hopes to complete the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course. In the future, my goal is to have my own business using my photograpy and videography skills to sell homes. I am very excited for this next chapter of my life and all the opportunities it will bring.</p>
